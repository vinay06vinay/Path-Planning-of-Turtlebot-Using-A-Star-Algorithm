# Instructions to Run the Code : 

1. From the extracted zip file, take out the "Proj3_vinay_anuj.py" file from code folder and open any Python IDE or terminal
3. If Python IDE is used, please click on the run button
Note : Before running please make sure whether these libraries are installed in the system : numpy,cv2,matplotlib,time.
Any Library not present can be by typing below command in terminal window using pip:
       pip install numpy
       
## Input Format for Two Test Cases : Click on enter after entering a value at each prompt

### Test Case 1 : 
	Enter the radius of the robot (0-5)
	 2
	Enter the clearance of the robot (0-5)
	 3
	Enter the step-size of the robot (1-10)
	 5
	Enter the x-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Enter the y-coordinate of start node
	 6
	Initial Orientation of start node of robot(Angle in multiple of 30)
	 60
	Enter the x-coordinate of goal node
	 60
	Enter the y-coordinate of goal node
	 60
	Goal Orientation of goal node of robot(Angle in multiple of 30)
	 60
### Test Case 2 : 
	 Enter the radius of the robot (0-5)
	 2

4. Once the code is run, a few information about the code is printed on the console and the cv2 visualisation video is recorded and saved
5. Video will be saved under the name "A-Star.avi". Alternatively, you can find the video in below links
    TestCase1 Video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FZHrR5yEz_0Bz4RUl9DOmRtuZJ68GbDo/view?usp=sharing
    TestCase2 Video : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wkxxXue-OS3xE-1L-jHQshqVnFDqiDeJ/view?usp=sharing
6. If Using, VSCode or Spyder you will also see a final plot of the map using Opencv and Matplotlib
